  A(Neighborhood level environment variables) --> B(GIS tools)
  C(Street level environment variables ) --> D(ML algorithm)
  E(Labels from citizens)
  B --> F(Correlation)
  D --> F

```{python}
# this is a code chunk/block that executes python code
a = 1 + 3
print(a)
```

An inline equation: $E = mc^2$

A block equation:

$$
\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3}
$$

Another equation:

$E = mc^2$
