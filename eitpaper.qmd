## Introduction
Walkability has been studied a lot. Based on optional or necessary activity, we could refer recreational walking as optional walking which are more influenced by environment. At the same time, many studies show that the necessary activity refer as utility walking where walking are rarely affected by environment[@alfonzo2005walk].

## Method
The path between 0 to 200 meters are removed and only the path longer than 200m according to previous studies [@basu2022street, @miranda2021desirable] are used for analysis. Gap, the previous analysis only focus the walking in general, but not separate utility walking and recreational walking. Our study focuses on both and comparing the difference between . Gap2, the previous studies mainly focus on the trip between 200 meters and 1000 meters \citep{basu2022street, sevtsuk2021big} , we have longer distance.
Here is a @fig-mindmap shows the workflow of the research.

```{python}
# this is a code chunk/block that executes python code
a = 1 + 3
print(a)
```

An inline equation: $E = mc^2$

A block equation:

$$
\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3}
$$

## Results
```{python}
#| label: hello-block-python
#| echo: false
from plotnine import *
from plotnine.data import penguins
(
    ggplot(
      data=penguins,
      mapping=aes(x="flipper_length_mm", y="body_mass_g")
    )
    + geom_point()
)
